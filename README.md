📊 I'm Adit, bachelor of Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering Physics, ITS.

📚 Passion in working with statistical softwares and keep growing my data analytics skills through my project and courses. I’m also looking foward to collaborate on data science projects.

🔍 I've always loved playing around with data, it amazes me how I could put data into different formats, different visualizations, and then make sense out of that data. My interests in the field of data have made me eager to work as a data analyst/data scientist.
